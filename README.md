My name is [Abraham Arbelaez](https://abraham-arbelaez.github.io/), and I am the Teaching Assistant for the class taught by [Dr. Gary Gadbury](https://www.k-state.edu/stats/about/people/gadbury.html). I am excited to embark 
in this journey together! As Dr. Gadbury already said, we will be using [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) to perform operations and analyze data. R can look intimidating at first, but no worries! These guides 
are aimed to help you understand the material even more and implement some healthy statistics and coding into your lives.

My teaching philosophies are engagement, hands-on and student-centered learning. I was too in your shoes and sometimes trying to learn a concept was tough when I was certainly not interested in the data itself. 
There are three different folders:

- Materials: These are interactive html files and have code snippets, that way you can replicate it and later run it on your own! If you have additional questions and/or suggestions please do reach out!

- Datasets: These are the datasets that are included in the material documents, that way you can download them and follow the materials with the dataset. If you don't know how to download a csv file, check this tutorial
I made!

- Multimedia: These are videos where I show some questions that students have.
 
Disclaimer: This additional material is not intended to be a replacement of the textbook nor lectures. It is no secret that students that read the textbook and go to class tend to perform very well.
